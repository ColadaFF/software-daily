Well, hello!

This repository houses the code for the future [softwaredaily.com](http://softwaredaily.com). This project is in the very early stages: we're still trying to figure out what purpose the application should serve, how it could be useful to the software development community, what features the MVP should have, etc.

Here are some of our ideas so far:

- Build an open-source news & information site about software.
- Take cues from [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/), but create an interface that's more powerful and easier to use.
- Make the site useful for a wide audience (i.e., allow our users to customize & tailor their feed so that they can discover content that's relevant to them, and suppress the content that isn't as relevant).

Perhaps the most exciting of these three points is the prospect of using the open-source model. This would mean that our users (mostly coders?) can add features, fix bugs, etc.

At the time of this writing, this is what the interface looks like:

![Interface Example A](/docs/images/interface-example-a.png?raw=true "Interface Example A")

![Interface Example B](/docs/images/interface-example-b.png?raw=true "Interface Example B")

![Interface Example C](/docs/images/interface-example-c.png?raw=true "Interface Example C")

![Interface Example C](/docs/images/interface-example-d.png?raw=true "Interface Example D")

*(Jeff T. speaking...)*

My goal has been to get a working interface up as fast as possible, so that we can try out features and figure out what works best. This means that I've pretty much exclusively been working on the user interface, and am using static sample data.

I think it would be helpful to dialogue with some other people who are interested in working on the project (that's you!) to spitball ideas and discuss our visions for the project. I created a Slack team for this project, which can be found here: https://software-daily.slack.com.

If you're interested in working on the project, or have ideas about how you want to contribute, feel free to [join the Slack team](https://software-daily-slack.herokuapp.com/) and post a message to the [#general](https://software-daily.slack.com/messages/general/) or [#project-vision](https://software-daily.slack.com/messages/project-vision/) channel.

If you'd like to check out the UI code that we have so far, head on over to [client/README.md](client/README.md).
